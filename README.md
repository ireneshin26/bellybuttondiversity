# Belly Button Diversity

## Overview of Project
In this analysis, Improbable Beef is searching for bacteria that will provide the best taste. The hypothesis is that ideal bacteria to make synthetic beef is found in the belly button. We are helping our client, Roza, who wants to build dashboard that research participants and researchers can access. The dashboard would include specific data by the research participants' IDs to show the following:

* Demographic panel of the participant
* Bar chart of the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the participant's belly button samples
* Bubble chart showing the bacteria cultures found in the participant's belly button samples, with the size of the bubbles corresponding to the amount found
* Guage chart that displays the test subject's weekly washing frequency's value as a measure from 0 - 10.

## Deliverables
* Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart: This bar chart shows the top 10 bacteria cultures that were found in the test subject's samples. The x axis depicts the OTU ID and the y axis depicts the amount of each sample present. You can hover over the values for more details.
* Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart: This bubble chart depicts the test subject's OTU IDs as the x axis value, sample values as the y axis values and the marker size. You can hover over each bubble for additional details.
* Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart: This gauge chart displays test subject's weekly washing frequency's value as a measure from 0 - 10 on the progress bar when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
* Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard: The following changes were conducted to the dashboard:
  * Add an image to the jumbotron.
  * Add background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage.
  * Add more information about the project as a paragraph on the page.
  * Add information about what each graph visualizes, either under or next to each graph.
